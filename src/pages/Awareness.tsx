      question: "What is renewable energy?",
      answer: "Renewable energy comes from sources that naturally replenish themselves, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels, these sources won't run out and generally have a much lower environmental impact."
    },
    {
      question: "Which renewable energy source is most efficient?",
      answer: "Efficiency varies by location and context. Solar PV panels typically convert 15-22% of sunlight into electricity, while wind turbines can convert up to 45% of wind energy. Hydroelectric power is one of the most efficient, converting up to 90% of available energy into electricity."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost to install solar panels?",
      answer: "The cost varies widely based on location, system size, and quality. As of 2023, a typical residential solar panel system (5-10kW) costs between $15,000-$25,000 before tax credits and incentives, which can reduce costs by 30% or more. Prices continue to decline as technology improves."
    },
    {
      question: "Can renewable energy completely replace fossil fuels?",
      answer: "Yes, with proper implementation of a diverse mix of renewable sources, energy storage solutions, and grid modernization, renewable energy can theoretically replace fossil fuels entirely. Many countries are working toward 100% renewable energy goals, though the transition will take time and significant investment."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the environmental benefits of renewable energy?",
      answer: "Renewable energy significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, minimizes water usage (except for some hydropower), reduces habitat destruction from fuel extraction, and decreases waste products associated with fossil fuels. This helps combat climate change and protect ecosystems."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I start using renewable energy at home?",
      answer: "You can start with simple steps like installing solar panels, using small wind turbines if suitable for your location, switching to a green energy provider, using solar water heaters, improving energy efficiency, and even participating in community solar projects if direct installation isn't possible."
